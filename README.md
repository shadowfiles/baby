A text adventure inspired by Ernest Hemingway's baby shoes story.

"For sale: baby shoes, never worn"

Baby Shoes was created for an English project at Georgia Tech. The goal of the game is to extend the feeling of the original baby shoes short story by putting the player in an abandoned house filled with various items that tell the stories of the people who once lived there.  

The project is currently somewhat incomplete as many parts of its content and puzzles were truncated to meet the class deadline.
